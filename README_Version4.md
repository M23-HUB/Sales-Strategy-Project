# Sales Method Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the outcomes of three different sales methods to determine which is most effective. Using Python, various business metrics and visualizations were generated to support actionable recommendations.

## Business Problem
Companies often use multiple sales strategies, but it's not always clear which delivers the best results. This project compares three sales methods using real business data and metrics to identify the most successful approach.

## Objectives
- Analyze key metrics for each sales method.
- Visualize performance using charts and tables.
- Recommend the optimal sales method based on data-driven insights.

## Data & Methodology
- **Data Sources:** CSV file 
- **Analysis Steps:**
  1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  2. Calculation of business metrics (e.g., conversion rate, revenue, customer acquisition cost).
  3. Visualization (bar charts, pie charts, etc.).
  4. Comparative analysis and recommendations.

## Key Results
- The ‘Email + Call’ group has a higher median sales count, a larger volume and a higher median revenue compared to the other two groups making it the most profitable strategy per customer.

## Technologies Used

**Python**: 

  1. Pandas, 
  2. Matplotlib.pyplot
  3. Seaborn
  4. Pingouin


## Results & Recommendations
- Based on this analysis my recommendation would be to allocate more resources to this hybrid method ‘**Email + Call**’ since customers that received this method seemed to purchase more items on average and spend more on those purchases. In addition, we can see that a follow up Call after receiving an email seems to create a more qualitative engagement with the customers compared to just receiving only an Email.

- For the '**Call**' method we could analyse the call logs to identify revenue_driving behaviors.

- And for the '**Email**' method we could perform A/B test variants such as personalized content to improve conversion
