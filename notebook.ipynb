{"cells":[{"source":"# Data Validation Process\n\n### For the preparetion of the data, the ETL proccess that was taking are as followed.\n\nAfter defining the 5 percent threshold and removing the columns with rows exciding the threshold, no column was removed, hence the file 'product_sales.csv' has eight (8) columns and fiftheen thousand (15000) rows in most columns:\n\n- **week**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n- **sales_method**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n- **customer_id**: 15000 rows, all unique ID with no missing values.\n- **nb_sold**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n- **revenue**: 13926 rows with 1074 missing values, filled those missing values with the median revenue from the number of products sold.\n- **years_as_customer**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n- **nb_site_visits**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n- **state**: 15000 rows with no missing values.\n\nFinal result is a dataframe with fiftheen thousand (15000) rows in all eight (8) columns\n\n# Analysis\n\n## The purpose of this analysis is to understand which method is most efficient in promoting a new product.\n\n### For this test, 3 groups were made:\n\n-  The ‘**Email**’ group, where the customers received and email during product launch and a follow up email three weeks later,\n\n- The ‘**Call**’ group, where the customers received a call from the sales team that lasted about 30’ per customer on average,\n\n- And lastly the ‘**Email + Call**’ group, where the customers first received an email then were called a week later by the sales team to discuss possible needs. The call in this scenario lasted about 10’ per customer on average.\n\n### To understand which method is the most profitable, we must first find:\n\n- What is the number of customers in each approach?\n\n- What does the revenue look like overall and by each method?\n\n- And if there was any difference over time for each method.\n\n### From the data we see that our test sample is as followed\n\n![Total number of customers (1)](Total%20number%20of%20customers%20(1).png)\n\n![Proportion of Total Number of Customers by Each Method](Proportion%20of%20Total%20Number%20of%20Customers%20by%20Each%20Method.png)\n\nThe total number of customers in this test was 15,000 however we can see that they were not evenly distributed with the ‘**Email**’ group occupying **50%** followed by the ‘**Call**’ group with **33%** and ‘**Email + Call**’ being **17%**.\n\nHowever when we look at the revenue spread we can see that the results do not have the same proportion. \n\n![Proportion of Total revenue by Method](Proportion%20of%20Total%20revenue%20by%20Method.png)\n\nIt would seem that the ‘Email’ group was the most efficient method since it brought in 50% of the total revenue, however after taking a closer look we can see that there is another group that seems a bit promising, so before we make our final conclusion, let's see how each group performed over time.\n\nIf we look at the revenue accross our testing period we see that it fluctuates.\n\n![Revenue Across Week After Product Launch](Revenue%20Across%20Week%20After%20Product%20Launch.png)\n\nTo better understand this behaviour we must dig a little bit deeper and see how the revenue looks like by each method.\n\n![Revenue by Method Across Week After Product Launch](Revenue%20by%20Method%20Across%20Week%20After%20Product%20Launch.png)\n\nWe can see that the revenue of the ‘**Email**’ group had a very strong first week with a revenue of about 84% of the week's total revenue, which as a result created a strong first week in total, however it doesn’t maintain its profit numbers which drop by every week.\n\nFor the ‘**Call**’ group the revenue seems to not take off, keeping a relatively consistent revenue with a slight increase as the weeks go by.\n\nLastly, the revenue of the ‘**Email + Call**’ group however seems to have the opposite effect compared to the ‘**Email**’ group, by having its first week being the weakest and increasing over time being the most profitable method out of the three after the fourth week.\n\nSo far we have seen how the total revenue looks like by each method used, but what would we get if we were interested in the  purchase made by each customer. \n\n![Number of Sales by Method](Number%20of%20Sales%20by%20Method.png)\n\nWe can see that the ‘**Email + Call**’ group has a higher median sales count and a larger volume compared to the other two groups. Also seeing a narrower variability (IQR) indicates a more consistent performance.\n\n![Sales Revenue by Method](Sales%20Revenue%20by%20Method.png)\n\nWe can also see that in terms of revenue the customers that received the ‘**Email + Call**’ treatment dominated with a higher median revenue and higher revenue outliers making it the most profitable strategy per customer. The ‘**Email**’ and ‘**Call**’ group on the other hand are showing a lower and more variable revenue distribution.\n\n![Engagement by Method](Engagement%20by%20Method.png)\n\nLastly, if we take a look at the number of engagement, we see that the ‘**Email + Call**’ group has a slightly higher median compared to the other two methods. \n\nNow, what information do we get from this graph ? \n\nEven though the ‘**Email**’ group has a higher customer count, the median number of sales and median sales per customer are not the highest of the three groups. \n\nIn the ‘**Call**’ group the average sales are the lowest among the three groups with the exception of a few outliers.\n\n# Business Metrics\n\nThe purpose of this test is to determine which method is most efficient, for that I would recommend using the Number of items sold, Revenue and Engagement, per customer as our metrics moving forward. \n\nFrom our data we see that based on the last 6 weeks there has been an increase in the ‘Email + Call’ groups revenue, so more customers were to receive this treatment and the metrics do not digress, that would be a good indicator that the method can get us closer to our goals.\n\n# Summery\n\nBased on this analysis my recommendation would be to allocate more resources to this hybrid method ‘**Email + Call**’ since customers that received this method seemed to purchase more items on average and spend more on those purchases. In addition, we can see that a follow up Call after receiving an email seems to create a more qualitative engagement with the customers compared to just receiving only an Email.\n\nFor the 'Call' method we could analyse the call logs to identify revenue_driving behaviors.\n\nAnd for the 'Email' method we could perform A/B test variants such as personalized content to improve conversion\n\n### That concludes my report. Until next time, have a good day.\n","metadata":{},"id":"bdba739c-d7aa-45d5-88c3-548a86ad33ef","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
